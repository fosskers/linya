//! Simple concurrent progress bars.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! - Intuitive API.
//! - First-class support for `rayon`, etc.
//! - Efficient, allocation-free redraws.
//! - Addition of new subbars on-the-fly.
//! - Single-threaded multi-bars.
//! - Light-weight, only a single dependency.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! `linya` is designed around the multi-bar case, and unlike other progress bar
//! libraries, has no separate type for individual bars. Instead, we use the
//! [`Progress`] type, a "bar coordinator".
//!
//! ## Multi Bars
//!
//! To mutably access a [`Progress`] across threads it must be wrapped in the
//! usual [concurrent sharing types][arcmutex]. With `rayon` specifically, only
//! `Mutex` is necessary:
//!
//! ```
//! use std::sync::Mutex;
//! use linya::{Bar, Progress};
//! use rayon::prelude::*;
//!
//! let progress = Mutex::new(Progress::new());
//!
//! // `into_par_iter()` is from `rayon`, and lets us parallelize some
//! // operation over a collection "for free".
//! (0..10).into_par_iter().for_each(|n| {
//!   let bar: Bar = progress.lock().unwrap().bar(50, format!("Downloading {}", n));
//!
//!   // ... Your logic ...
//!
//!   // Increment the bar and draw it immediately.
//!   // This is likely called in some inner loop or other closure.
//!   progress.lock().unwrap().inc_and_draw(&bar, 10);
//! });
//! ```
//!
//! Notice that new bars are added on-the-fly from within forked threads. We
//! call [`Progress::bar`] to obtain a new "bar handle", and then pass that
//! handle back to the parent `Progress` when incrementing/drawing.
//!
//! See [`Progress::inc_and_draw`] and [`Progress::set_and_draw`] to advance and
//! render the bars.
//!
//! ## Single Bars
//!
//! `Progress` can also be used in a single-threaded context for individual
//! bars. The usage is the same, except that no locking is required:
//!
//! ```
//! use linya::{Bar, Progress};
//!
//! let mut progress = Progress::new();
//! let bar: Bar = progress.bar(50, "Downloading");
//!
//! // Use in a loop, etc.
//! progress.set_and_draw(&bar, 10);
//! ```
//!
//! In this way, you could even have multi-bars in a single-threaded context.
//!
//! # Caveats
//!
//! Some of the points below may be fixed in future releases.
//!
//! - Your terminal must support ANSI codes.
//! - No dedicated render thread, to keep usage simple.
//! - No bar templating, to avoid dependencies.
//! - No other bar styling ([yet]).
//! - No "rates", since rerenders are not time-based.
//! - No bar clearing after completion.
//! - No spinners, also due to no sense of time.
//! - No dynamic resizing of bars if window size changes.
//!
//! If you need more customizable progress bars and are willing to accept
//! heavier dependencies, please consider [indicatif].
//!
//! Note also that using more than one `Progress` at the same time leads to
//! unspecified behaviour.
//!
//! # Trivia
//!
//! *Linya* is the Quenya word for "pool", as in a [beautiful mountain pool][mirrormere].
